    "\n",
    "There are several options we can consider to segment the TTS data:\n",

    "2. Randomly assigning segments to TTS data based on a weighted probability distribution of similar students from the SMTO data.\n",
    "3. Some combination of 1 and 2.\n",
    "4. Change the segmentation approach so that the information is implictly available (e.g. replace \"living with family\" segments with \"living with 1+ children or 2+ adults\")\n",
    "5. Use a machine learning approach such as clustering on the samples and compare results to establish a common segmentation approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon discussing these options, we decided to use a machine learning algorthm to classify students from the TTS data according to living arrangement. That is our next step."
