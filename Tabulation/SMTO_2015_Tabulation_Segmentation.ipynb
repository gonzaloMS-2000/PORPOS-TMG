    "# 2015 StudentMoveTO Survey Data - Tabulation and Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we tabulate the data from the 2015 StudentMoveTO Survey. This includes paying specific attention to factors such as age, gender, and the distribution of respondents by affiliated university and campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing a literature review and discussing our findings, we have hypothesized that running the gravity model with  different groups of students may yield very different results. For instance, the model may result in a better fit for students who live away from home rather than at home. One Danish study in particular used this as a key differentiating factor in university choices. As a result, we have labelled the data into a number of segments. We explain this process below.\n",

    "Now, we are going to use this data to segment the respondents into 13 categories (from 0 to 12). First, respondents are labelled according to their level of education (first-year undergrad, upper-year undergrad, grad, other). We hypothesize that the gravity model might have different results for first-year undergrads (due to guarantted on-campus housing) than upper-year undergrads and graduate students. Respondents of other affiliations (Continuing Studies, Faculty, etc.) were labelled as segment 0, as we will not be analyzing this group. Within each student group, we segmented the respondents according to their enrolment status (full-time or part-time) and whether they identified that they liveds with their parents/family or in another living arrangement. The labels used for each segment are listed in the table below:\n",

    "Some interesting observations from this segmented distribution of respondents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For those in First Year and studying Full-time, about __2/3__ of students live with their families/parents.\n",
    "- A similar thing can be said for Undergrads not-in-first-year who study Full-time, where about __2/3__ of them live at home.\n",
    "- For those enrolled Full-time Graduate studies, about __72%__ of them live without their families/parents, which makes sense considering their older age compared to typical undergraduate students.\n",
    "- Because there are a lot less Part-time students than there are Full-time sutdens, the difference between part-time students that live at home vs those who don't (from each \"level\" group) do not show a very significanct difference. However, one thing we can observe from this group is that approximately __31%__ of Part-time grad students live at home, which also makes sense due to their age and the high probability that they are working while they study.\n",

    "We are planning to run a doubly-constrained gravity model, as was done by Joven using TTS data, on the different segments and combinations thereof. With some luck, we might find that the gravity-based model is acceptable for specific types of students (e.g. those living at/away from home, undergrads/grads) and compare these results to those from TTS. If the gravity model appears more promising after segmenting the population of students, we will attempt to perform a similar segmentation analysis on TTS data and compare our findings with Joven's results.\n",

    "Furthermore, we can consider a number of other factors that can help predict university choice. From our literature review, we have identified that factors such as income level and university characteristics (tuition, selectivity, etc.) may be correlated with this choice. Incorporating these factors into the analysis may yield more accurate results."
