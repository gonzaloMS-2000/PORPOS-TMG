This folder contains work on estimating ASCs for schools in the 2019 SMTO dataset for which the enrollment is unavailable.
We used Biogeme (Python) for this due to greater versatility in defining different utility functions.

We estimate these for:
- Colleges only
- Universities only
- Full choice set with family:distance interaction term
- Full choice set without family:distance interaction term

Code files (outdated):
