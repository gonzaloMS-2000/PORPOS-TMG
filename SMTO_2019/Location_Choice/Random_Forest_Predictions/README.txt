This folder contains our work on integrating Random Forest classifications for student's predicted school type
(university or college) in the 2019 SMTO location choice problem
The combined model adds a term to the utility of schools based on their type and the random forest predictions.
The segregated model estimates separate models for university choice and college choice. Students are assigned to a mode based on RF predictions.
