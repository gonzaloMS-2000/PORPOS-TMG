    "We used the Model Builder and ML.NET through visual studio to train a machine learning algorithm to classify students as either living with family or not according to attributes that are avilable in both SMTO and TTS. The model was trained on labelled data from SMTO (where living arrangements were available), and ran on the unlabelled TTS dataset.\n",

    "### Chosen Algorithm and Evaluation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm selected by model builder was `LightGbmBinary`. When tested against a reserved portion of the training data, the model had an accuracy of __91.65%__, an AUC and AUPRC of __97.00%__, and an F1-score of __92.47%__.\n",

    "## Overall Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Right away we saw that the percentage of students living with their families is different from the SMTO to the TTS dataset. While in SMTO we have 56% of students living at home, in TTS we have 68% of students living at home. This is a relatively significant difference, and it leads us to a question of how to compare the SMTO and TTS results. The correlations between living arrangement and other attributes cannot be directly compared since the distributions are not the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - __Possible Reason:__\n",
    "A possible reason for the bigger percentage of students living at home in the TTS dataset could be that TTS is a household survey, and thus, it is possible that the majority of students who obtained and filled out this survey were living at their family's household. StudentMoveTO, however, is a survey sent to all students.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __Possible Solution:__\n",
    "A possible solution for this could be to normalize the results so that we can conduct an objective comparison. However, we would need some guidance on how to perform this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We were expecting to see an increase in the proportion of students living at home for all groups explored above due to the fact that there are more students living with their families overall. However, this did not turn out to be the case when analyzing the correlation between living arrangement and students 18 or over who live with children under 18, or number of children in the household.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we normalize the above results about student's living arrangement to obtain an unbiased comparison between both SMTO and TTS surveys?\n",
    "- Could we use this machine learning technique to also predict the education level of students? (ie. Whether they are in an undergrad or graduate program). This would allow us to develop a similar segmentation for TTS as we did for SMTO. Alternatively, it could be used to just stick to age for any segmentation needs or try to use it as an explanatory variable for whatever location choice model we come up with instead.\n",
    "- When we ran the machine learning program, we noticed that there are some attribute columns that, when removed, only decreased the accuracy of the algorithm by very small amounts (ex. from 91.65% accuracy to 90.40%). From this observation we inferred that such columns have little correlation with the student's living arrangement, so is it worth it to keep these columns, or should we remove them given that the accuracy changes by very little?"
