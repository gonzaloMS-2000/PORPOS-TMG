This folder contains our work on the accessibility location choice model for SMTO 2015.
The accessibility model includes a term that is the inclusive value (expected maximum utility) from the mode choice model.

Code files:
- Accessibility.ipynb (outdated): Our accessibility work in Biogeme, used to create Biogeme_Results.xlsx
- Simple_Accessibility.R: Accessibility results with the doubly-constrained gravity model (ASCs)
- Proposed_Accessibility.R: Accessibility results with the proposed model (enrollment, closest dummies, family:distance)

Results files:
- Biogeme_Results.xlsx: Segmented results for accessibility model for singly- and doubly-constrained models
- R_Results.xlsx: Results from Simple_Accessibility.R

The Outdated folder includes older work in R with segmented accessibility models.
