This folder contains work on our basic gravity model for the 2015 SMTO location choice problem.
We compare results for different segments when the model is run with alternative-specific constants (ASCs)
to when the log of enrollment is used instead, with or without a beta parameter.

Code:
- ASCs_vs_Enrollment.ipynb: Code generating segmented results for gravity models with ASCs or enrollment

Results files:
- Segmented_Results.xlsx: Results for three models per segment (ASCs, with B_Enrol, without B_Enrol)
