### Project Description
This repository includes our work on Place of Residence - Place of School modelling for post-secondary students. The work was completed in May - August of 2020.
Over the course of the summer, we used data from the 2015 and 2019 StudentMoveTO (SMTO) surveys, and 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS).

### Usage
For the TMG technical report put together see https://tmg.utoronto.ca/files/Place%20of%20School_Loctation_Choice%20Modelling.pdf or "Place of School Location Choice Modelling.pdf".
Subfolders in this repository include `README.txt` text files which contain important information about the files included in that subfolder.
This folder contains a draft of Ethan's summary report of this project, "Summary_Report.docx", as well as "Metrics.R", a file containing useful functions for R implementation of the logit models.
