# PORPOS-TMG
In this project, we investigate post-secondary school location choices of students in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) for travel demand modelling applications.

Our paper titled "Modelling GTHA Post-Secondary School Location Choice" was presented by Ethan Baron at the 2021 Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) Conference & Exhibition (see https://www.tac-atc.ca/en/conference/papers/modelling-gtha-post-secondary-school-location-choice).

### Project Description
This repository includes our work on Place of Residence - Place of School modelling for post-secondary students. The work was completed in May - August of 2020.
Over the course of the summer, we used data from the 2015 and 2019 StudentMoveTO (SMTO) surveys, and 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS).

### Usage
For the TMG technical report put together see https://tmg.utoronto.ca/files/Place%20of%20School_Loctation_Choice%20Modelling.pdf or `Place of School Location Choice Modelling.pdf`.
Subfolders in this repository include `README.txt` text files which contain important information about the files included in that subfolder.
This folder contains a draft of Ethan's summary report of this project, `Summary_Report.docx`, as well as `Metrics.R`, a file containing useful functions for R implementation of the logit models.
